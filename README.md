# Lazy Llama Ledger
Want to keep track of your personal finances in a simple yet categorised manner?

Lazy Llama Ledger is a simple ledger app which lets you save any purchases and income - categorised and subcategorised. Then view reports to see how much you're spending, and what you're spending the most money on.

LLL is a webapp, with the inner workings all run locally on the user's machine as a self-hosted RESTful service.

LLL is still a work in progress.
