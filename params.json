{"name":"Lazy Llama Ledger","tagline":"A simple self-hosted Ledger Service","body":"# What it is\r\nLazy Llama Ledger is an easy to use personal ledger webapp which is hosted locally. You can log your purchases and your income - in categories and subcategories. You can later generate reports to see what exactly you're spending your money on.\r\n\r\nIt's also free. And Open Source.\r\n\r\n# What it is (technically)\r\nLazy Llama Ledger comes in two parts. The server, and the webapp. The server is a simple form application which hosts within it a webserver. The Webapp is a single page website. To use LLL, you simply open the server (the webpage opens automatically), keeping it open till you're done, then closing it. All the data is stored locally on files, so no sensitive data is transmitted over the internet.\r\n\r\n# System Requirements\r\n- Windows\r\n- .NET Framework 4.5\r\n- An HTML 5 Capable Browser\r\n\r\n# Where to get it\r\n[Download the latest version from the Release Page](https://github.com/Haedrian/LazyLlamaLedger/releases)\r\n\r\n# What's done so far\r\n* Categories\r\n* Subcategories\r\n* Category and Subcategory Pie Chart Generation\r\n* Summary and Graphs over a number of months \r\n\r\n# Installing it\r\n1. Download the latest version from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/Haedrian/LazyLlamaLedger/releases)\r\n2. Unzip it to a folder of your choice\r\n3. Run the shortcut in the root folder\r\n4. If it is your first time, you will need to choose the location to save files in. Pick one, or cancel for a default to be chosen.\r\n5. Start using it. When you're done, simply close the application. \r\n\r\n# Updating It\r\n1. Download the latest version from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/Haedrian/LazyLlamaLedger/releases)\r\n2. Delete the previous version\r\n3. Unzip it to a folder of your choice\r\n4. It will remember the location of the files\r\n\r\n# How to Use it\r\nInstall it as above. To start the application, simply open the shortcut. The webpage will open. When you're done, simply close the server. Note that if minimised, it will hide in your system tray.\r\n\r\nThe first time, you will be asked whether you wish to load the Category Starter Pack - this gives you a number of ready-made categories. If you decline and change your mind later, you can load them from settings. Otherwise you will start with two miscellaneous categories.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\nLedger Tab\r\n![Screenshot of Ledger Tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Haedrian/LazyLlamaLedger/master/Screenshots/LedgerTab.png)\r\nMonthly Breakdown Charts\r\n![Charts Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Haedrian/LazyLlamaLedger/master/Screenshots/charts.PNG)\r\nAdding a New Ledger Entry\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Haedrian/LazyLlamaLedger/master/Screenshots/AddNewLedgerEntry.PNG)\r\nCategories\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Haedrian/LazyLlamaLedger/master/Screenshots/catTab.PNG)\r\n\r\n# What's coming up next\r\n* Recurring Payments\r\n* Payments spread over multiple months\r\n* Encryption and Authentication\r\n* Multiple Wallets","google":"UA-74109946-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
